<h1>Include Widget Demo</h1>
<p>
  The include widget provides a simple mechanism for composing views from
  reusable fragments of html.  This makes it easy to keep common page
  elements, such as headers, navigation, and footers, in separate files for
  maintainability.
<p>
  The markup inserted by an include widget can also contain additional
  widget declarations, even other includes. This allows includes to act
  as a simple templating system for composing views.
