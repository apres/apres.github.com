## More Markdown ##

This markdown content was included from another file on demand. Markdown is
a lot more convenient to write than HTML for text content. Due to
cross-domain restrictions, the file must reside on the same server as the
web page.  Regardless, this makes it pretty easy to include user generated
content into your pages.
