# Apres #

_Embarrassingly Client-Side Web Apps._

Apres is an integrated suite of tools for building web applications that can run entirely in your browser. Its modular design allows you to build your application brick-by-brick, and also allows you complete freedom to customize the components or invent your own from scratch.

Apres has a compact core that provides a foundation for modular web development with a focus on declarative programming for common tasks. However, it hides none of the full power that the underlying browser environment provides. Instead, Apres provides leverage to make it possible to build complex systems from simple parts.

## Client-side web development should be fun, really. ##

Development should be about solving your problems, and building your app. Often times this can seem secondary to a myriad of other obstacles and distractions. Apres aims to bring the focus back where it belongs.

## The batteries should not only be included, but fully charged and ready for use. ##

There are an astounding number of excellent open-source tools that you could leverage to make your app great. But finding and integrating all of these pieces is a major undertaking. Apres comes loaded with an assortment of modules ready for you to use right away, and more are being added all the time.

## If you don't need it, it shouldn't be in your way. ##

Having such an assortment of functionality is a burden if you have to worry about it even if your app doesn't use it. You don't want to be weighed down by things you don't need. Apres' modular approach means that you only pay for what you eat, and you can learn as you go.

## Modularity matters. ##

A global namespace is no place to build a modern app. Coupled with asynchronous script loading, and manual dependency management the standard browser runtime is no paradise for complex applications made of many interdependent parts. Apres leverages the powerful, and popular requirejs AMD module loader to create a firm foundation for modular apps. Apres provides AMD-compliant versions of many popular libraries. Requirejs can also automatically adapt many non-AMD modules for use with Apres.

## Use standards. ##

There's no lack of ways to do things in software development. Leveraging existing standards means there are less things to develop, debug, document, and learn about.

- Apres views are html5 pages, with dynamic functionality declared in html data attributes.
- Apres works with any standard web server, static, or dynamic. It plugs easily into node.js via an included express middleware adapter. Middleware for other popular application servers are planned.
Apres uses standard AMD javascript modules.
- Apres prefers composition over inheritance for application code. This means less dependence and tight coupling between your code and Apres since you can use plain objects.
