# Apres Widgets #

Widgets allow dynamic behavior to be attached to DOM elements on a page.
Widgets encapsulate dynamic logic and presentation in a reusable way. Widgets
can be attached directly to an element by adding some attributes to its html
tag:

``` html
<div class="widget" data-widget="widget/markdown"></div>
```

When Apres is loaded for a page, it will automatically scan for widgets after
the DOM is ready, and the page controller, if specified, is loaded.  Widget
elements must declare class `"widget"` as above. This ensures that Apres can
find all of the page elements with widgets as efficiently as possible.  Note
that is it fine for the widget element to declare other classes as well so
long as one of them is `"widget"`.

The second `data-widget` attribute declares the widget [module](modules.md).
This is a requirejs module path. This module is loaded on demand and used to
construct the widget instance. The instance is then attached to the DOM
element.

Some widgets can accept additional parameters. The `markdown` widget used
above can accept a `src` parameter that allows you to specify an external
resource containing the markdown source text. Let's see what that looks 
like in the html:

``` html
<div class="widget" data-widget="widget/markdown" data-widget-src="/doc/rambling.md"></div>
```

All widget parameters are specified using `data-widget-` attributes. When
the widget is instantiated, the parameters are passed in by Apres. In this
case the text will be fetched from `/doc/rambling.md` and passed into the
widget.

When a widget is constructed it is passed in the DOM element, and any
additional parameters. The widget code is free to do whatever is appropriate
from there. In most cases a widget will manipulate the element it is attached
to. In the case of the markdown widget, it will render the source text into
html, then replace the content of the widget element with that generated
markup. This result is that the markdown is formatted and displayed in the
browser as expected.

## Adding Widgets From Scripts ##

Apres also provides an API for imperatively adding widgets to a page from
Javascript. This can be very useful for inserting widgets programmatically
in response to some user action after the page has loaded. This simple example
loads a markdown widget as above, but from Javascript:

``` javascript
apres.widget('#my-element', 'widget/markdown');
```

The first argument `#my-element` selects the DOM element for the widget. The
second argument is the requirejs module path, just like `data-widget` above.
As above, we can also pass in a source text URI:

``` javascript
apres.widget('#my-element', 'widget/markdown', {src: '/doc/rambling.md'});
```

Here we pass in the `src` parameter, similar to above. Parameters are passed
into the widget as an object hash. 

Note that `apres.widget()` is an async function, since Apres must load the
widget module before it can instantiate the widget. As a result, the function
doesn't return anything useful when instantiating a new widget. If we want
to get ahold of the widget object in our script, you need to pass a callback
to `apres.widget()`.

Continuing with our markdown example, suppose we wanted to supply the
markdown widget with some markdown source text directly from the script. As
it happens this cannot be done via a widget parameter, but the widget
instance has a `markdown()` function that we can use for this purpose.
We can call that from a callback after constructing the widget:

``` javascript
apres.widget('#my-element', 'widget/markdown', function(widget) {
  widget.markdown('# Frippertronics\n'
     + 'The romance of endless tape loops, and noodling guitars.');
});
```

## Accessing Existing Widgets on the Page ##

Most widget objects provide an api for manipulating them from a script.
However, we need to get the widget object first. This can be accomplished
by using `apres.widget()` passing it only the element selector:

``` javascript
var widget = apres.widget('#some-element');
```

If the element selected has a widget object installed, it is returned. From
there the script can manipulate the widget as it sees fit.

## Creating Custom Widgets ##

Widgets are a great way to encapsulate bits of application functionality.
Let's dive in and create the world's simplest hello world widget:

``` javascript
define(function() {
  return function(elem) {
    elem.html('Hello Widget World!');
  }
});
```

Create a directory called `widgets` in the root directory of your Apres app
(to create an app see the [Apres quick start](quickstart.md)), and save this
as a file named `hello.js` in the widgets directory.

To use your new widget, add this tag to an apres-enabled page:

``` html
<div class="widget" data-widget="/widgets/hello.js"></div>
```

Reload the page and voil√†! You've created a working widget!

It may not be exciting yet, but it is doing something, so let's examine the
code a little more closely. First line first:

``` javascript
define(function() {

});
```

The `define()` function is provided by requirejs to define modules.  All
widgets are defined in modules in this way. Our widget has no dependencies on
other modules yet, so we can simply pass `define()` a callback function where
the module contents reside. The callback function will be called when the
module is loaded, what it returns is the module object.  That part comes next:

``` javascript
  return function(elem) {
    elem.html('Hello Widget World!');
  }
```

Our widget module returns a function, a constructor function to be precise.
When Apres loads a widget module, it expects it to return the constructor
function to use to create the widget instance. When Apres creates a widget for
an element, the constructor is called with `new` and the element is passed in
as a jQuery wrapper for convenience.

Our simple widget doesn't do too much, it just sets the content of the widget
element and it's done. It doesn't do anything at all with the widget instance
(i.e. `this`), so a plain empty object is returned to Apres.

### Interactive Custom Widget

Next let's do something more interactive. Let's create a `question` widget
that allows you to easily write a question with a list of multiple choice
answers. The widget will turn the answers into radio buttons, and keep
track of the selected answer. Here's what you could write in the html
for a question:

``` html
<p>How many conies in a brace?</p>
<div class="widget" data-widget="/widgets/question.js">
  Zero
  Two
  Seven
  Seventy-Two
</div>
```

To make this work, we need to read the source text of the element, and create
some radio buttons. Here's an initial attempt for this widget:

``` javascript
define(function() {
  var qid = 0;
  return function(elem) {
    var questions = elem.html().split(/\n\s*/);
    var html = '';
    qid += 1
    for (var i = 1; i < questions.length; i++) {
      if (questions[i]) {
        html += '<label><input type="radio" name="q' + qid + '" value="' + i + '"/> '
             + questions[i] + '</label><br>';
      }
    }
    elem.html(html);
  }
});
```

The result looks like this:

### Wiring Up Events

Although now we can click on the buttons they don't actually do anything yet.
We need to add some simple logic to record the answer selection. To facilitate
that, Apres provides a mechanism for widgets to declaratively bind DOM events
to functions:

``` javascript
    this.events = {
      'change input[type="radio"]': function(evt) {
          this.answer = evt.target.value;
          console.log(this.answer);
      }
    }
```

Apres' event binding mechanism is inspired by Backbone.js. Widgets define
their event bindings via an `events` property. Each member in `events` defines
an event binding for elements inside the widget. The key for each binding is a
two-part string. The first part is the DOM event name to bind to. The optional
second part is a css selector for the element, or elements to listen to.

Widget event bindings are automatically limited to the widget element and
its children. That way you can have several widgets on the page listening
for the same events that do not interfere with each other.

The value for each event binding is either a function, or the name of a 
member function of the widget. When the event is triggered, this function is
called with the `event` object as it's first argument, and any other payload
in the remaining arguments. `this` is bound to the widget instance when the
method is invoked, for convenience.

In our example, we are bind the `change` DOM event of the radio buttons inside
the widget to a function. This function sets an `answer` property on the widget
to record the answer that was selected. It also logs the answer value to the 
console, so we can see it working. Below is the complete code of the question.js
widget with the event handling added in. Give it a try with the Javascript
console visible to see that it works.

``` javascript
define(function() {
  var qid = 0;
  var QuestionWidget = function(elem) {

    this.events = {
      'change input[type="radio"]': function(evt) {
          this.answer = parseInt(evt.target.value);
          console.log(this.answer);
      }
    }

    var questions = elem.html().split(/\n\s*/);
    var html = '';
    qid += 1;
    for (var i = 1; i < questions.length; i++) {
      if (questions[i]) {
        html += '<label><input type="radio" name="q' + qid + '" value="' + i + '"/> '
             + questions[i] + '</label><br>';
      }
    }
    elem.html(html);
  }
  return QuestionWidget;
});
```

### Widget Parameters

Now we record the answer in the widget, but there is no way to know if the answer
is correct or not. We need to provide a way to specify the correct answer for
each question widget. We can define a widget parameter for this purpose.

``` javascript
    QuestionWidget.widgetParams = {
      answer: {
        type: 'int',
        descr: 'The line number of the correct answer'
      }
    }
```

A widget can define parameters by adding a `widgetParams` property to its
constructor function. Apres will look for `widgetParams` when the widget is
loaded, and get the values of any cooresponding widget parameter attributes.
In this case, Apres will look for a `data-widget-answer` attribute on the
widget element.

Since the values of html attributes can only be strings, Apres provides a
mechanism to convert attribute values to other data types. The `answer`
parameter is declared with the type `int` above. As you might expect, Apres
will convert the attribute value to an integer. The converted parameter values
are passed to the widget constructor as an object in the second argument when
the widget is created. Note that if no parameters are specified, this argument
will be undefined, so we need to check that there are parameters at all before
checking for particular params. Let's revise the widget to accept the `answer`
parameter and store it in the widget instance:

``` javacript
define(function() {
  var qid = 0;
  var QuestionWidget = function(elem, params) {

    if (params && params.answer) {
      this.correctAnswer = params.answer;
    }

    ...
```

Next we'll define a member function in the widget to test the answer. It
will display a colored border to indicate if the answer is correct, or
incorrect. And it will disable the answer radio buttons so that the
user cannot change their answer after the fact.

``` javascript
    this.handleAnswer = function(evt) {
      var answer = parseInt(evt.target.value);
      if (answer === this.correctAnswer) {
        elem.css('border', '5px solid green');
      } else {
        elem.css('border', '5px solid red');
      }
      elem.find('input[type="radio"]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
    }
```

Now we need to change the event bindings to use the new `checkAnswer()`
function:

``` javascript
    this.events = {
      'change input[type="radio"]': 'handleAnswer'
    }
```

Using the function name as the binding value tells Apres to dispatch to that
member function. Using names instead of declaring the function directly in the
`events` object can help clarify the code, allow you to use a single function
for multiple events, and can make the widget easier to unit test.

The remainder of the widget code remains the same:

``` javascript
    var questions = elem.html().split(/\n\s*/);
    var html = '';
    qid += 1;
    for (var i = 1; i < questions.length; i++) {
      if (questions[i]) {
        html += '<label><input type="radio" name="q' + qid + '" value="' + i + '"/> '
             + questions[i] + '</label><br>';
      }
    }
    elem.html(html);
  }
  QuestionWidget.widgetParams = {
    answer: {
      type: 'int',
      descr: 'The line number of the correct answer'
    }
  }
  return QuestionWidget;
});
```
